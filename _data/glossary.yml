query:
  inputName:
    name: InputName
    def: The name of a Input (relation). In the example, `alice` and `bob` are inputs. The system has to know how to get real data from these inputs, which is an orthogonal task to formulating a query.
  alias:
    name: Alias
    def: the name of inputs used downstream in the queries. In this case, `a` and `b`. If no alias is specified, the InputName is used as alias; so internally an alias is always defined.
  attribute:
    name: Attribute
    def: Attributes of the relations, e.g. `x`, `y`, `q`, `r` and `s`. In order to avoid naming clashes, it is **forbidden** to use attributes without a qualifying alias.
  attributeAccess:
    name: AttributeAccess
    def: The pair of alias and attribute, e.g. `('a', 'q')` in the predicate `a.q = 1`.
  filterPredicate:
    name: FilterPredicate
    def: A predicate with a single input, e.g. `a.q = 1`. These can be evaluated at ingestion of the inputs or maybe even pushed down into the data sources.
  joinPredicate:
    name: JoinPredicate
    def: A predicate with two inputs, e.g. `a.r = b.s`, here tuples from both relations, `a` and `b` are needed in order to evaluate the predicate
optimization:
  inputRelation:
    name: InputRelation
    def: Relations that are inputs, i.e., new tuples are created by reading them from external sources.
  intermediateRelation:
    name: Intermediate Relation
    def: A relation which is created during processing inside Clash.
  relationName:
    name: RelationName
    def: The name that relations (` or intermediate) have assigned. They should be unique. Names of InputRelations should coincide with the Alias they get assigned in the query.
